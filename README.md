# EEG-EEM-Analysis-App
The main purpose of EEG/EMG (Electroencephalography/Electromyography) analysis is to study and understand the electrical activity of the brain (EEG) or muscle activity (EMG). 


## AI description for understanding and reference :
The app is initiated with a title "EEG/EMG Signal Analysis App" using st.title() from the Streamlit library.
The user can upload an EEG/EMG data file in EDF format using st.file_uploader(). The uploaded file is then processed further.
The uploaded file is saved as a temporary file using tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(). This allows access to the file's path for processing.
The EDF data is read using pyedflib.EdfReader() from the pyEDFlib library. The number of channels and channel names are extracted from the EDF file.
The signals from each channel are extracted using edf_data.readSignal(channel). The raw data is stored in a list and transposed into a NumPy array for further processing.
The sampling frequency (fs) is obtained from the first channel using edf_data.samplefrequency(0).
The preprocess_data() function applies signal processing operations to the raw data. In the provided code, it applies a high-pass filter using scipy.signal.butter() and scipy.signal.filtfilt(). You can customize the filtering parameters as per your needs.
The plot_signals() function is used to visualize the raw and filtered signals using Matplotlib. It creates a figure with two subplots, one for the raw signal and one for the filtered signal.
The processed data is passed to the plot_signals() function to generate the plot.
After the visualization, the EDF file is closed using edf_data.close() to release system resources.
Finally, the temporary file created earlier is deleted using os.remove(tmp_filename).
